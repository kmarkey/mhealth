## Introduction

In the past couple of years, during a global period of isolation, suffering, and uncertainty, mental health has increasingly become a concern for everyone. For many, mental health is a difficult subject. Public schools encourage little (if any) education on mental health, many families don't talk about it at home, and there is still a massive stigma around seeking help.

Mental health is a massive problem in the United States:

**In the US, an average of 40% of U.S. adults reported struggling with mental health or substance use**. That's higher than the percentage of people who report struggling with their physical health.Mental health is healthcare, and instead of placing mental health in its own category, we must accept, advocate for, and fund their operations.

**Suicide, the most severe outcome of mental health challenges, is the second-leading cause of death among people aged 10-34**. The importance of mental health cannot be overstated when it comes to protecting the lives of the people we love.

While a proper diagnosis isn't the only step in the mental health journey, its vital for patients who need therapies or funding from official organizations. It can mean the difference between a patient paying $1000 a month for treatment, or paying nothing. But diagnosis is a problem as well. **The average delay between onset of mental illness symptoms and treatment is 11 years**.

This project was made for a creative course in data analytics and data science. Here, we look at the state of mental health in the US, particularly in 2020, and the kinds of facilities available in each state to provide mental health treatment and care. This project uses both behavioral surveys and mental health facility data to explore mental health trends in each state, and the kinds of facilities available to treat different kinds of mental health cases.
 
This project was started in January 2022 and is still in development.
